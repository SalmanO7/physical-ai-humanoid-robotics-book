# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the documentation for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project. This book covers the design and implementation of an autonomous humanoid robot that can understand voice commands, navigate, identify objects, and manipulate them within simulated environments.

## Table of Contents

1. [Specification](specification.md) - Detailed feature requirements and user scenarios
2. [Implementation Plan](implementation-plan.md) - Technical approach and project structure
3. [Data Model](data-model.md) - Key entities and their relationships
4. [ROS 2 Interfaces](ros2-interfaces.md) - API contracts for the system
5. [Research Findings](research-findings.md) - Dependencies and assumptions
6. [Quickstart Guide](quickstart-guide.md) - Getting started with the project
7. [Feature Tasks](feature-tasks.md) - Implementation tasks breakdown

This project bridges digital AI with physical humanoid robots, enabling embodied intelligence through a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipeline.
